Graviton
========

Graviton is a Java-based 2D gravitational physics game.

It comes with a built-in level editor, to simplify the creation of new levels, though all levels are stored in a simple text-based format.

Graviton was developed in 2009, and is not currently under active development. It is posted as a demonstration of work only.
